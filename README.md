### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the bikes purchase decisions of commuters accross three regions of Europe, North America and the Pacific.

### Data Sources

Bike Purchase Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Bike_Buyers.xlx" file. Containing information about bike purchase decision of commuters.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning/Preparaion
  - [Data Set]()
- Pivot Table - Creating Charts
- Dashboard - Presenting Analysis

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

in the initial data preparation phase, we peformed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Removed duplicate data
3. Data cleaning/formating
4. Write "IF" statements to identify age brackets

### Data Analysis

We explored the bikes purchase data to answer key questions such as;
1. What is the average income of bike purchase by gender?
2. Is there a relationship between commute distance and bike purchase?
3. What is the age bracket of the most bike buyers?

### Data  Presentation

Below is the dashboard of the data analysis findings:

### Results/Findings

The fanalysis results are summarised as follows;
1. Average income by gender have a positive relationship with bike purchase decision. The higher the average income, the more bikes purchased by a group.
2. commuters with shorter mile distance have a high tendency of purchasing bikes. Mile distance have a negative relationship with bike purchase decision by commuters over time.
3. People under age 30 (Adolescents) are noot buying bikes. Aged 30-54 (Adults) are highest bike buyers, While older people from 55 and above have no motivation for purchasing bikes.

### Recommendations

Basedon the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
1. Invest and channel more marketing efforts to the male demographics as the highest income earners by average.
2. Implement a customer segmentation strategy targeting high-LTV commuters respectively.
3. Focus on expanding and promoting products to adults.

### Limitations

There was no limitation to this data set. although, there was a slight increase in bike purchase by commuters between 5-10 miles as against our findings, this could be due to other factors which could affect bike purchase other that distance. This could include among others, preferences, income and commuter demographic.
